For those unfamiliar, Vim is a console screen-based text editor. Vim is a clone of the Vi editor and stands for "Vi IMproved". It is free, open-source, and quite powerful indeed. It has some elegant features that many other editors lack. Leveraging features like motions and text objects can perform complex operations in few keystrokes making for a fast and productive workflow. Additionally, Vim has a vibrant community that develop plugins to extend functionality beyond just a text editor.  

With the ubiquity of Linux across cloud computing (and the fact that git uses it as the default editor), the odds of encountering Vim are high. The catch is that Vim's editing paradigms are different than most graphical editors. The intuitions developed in gui-based programs don't translate into a terminal editor and therefore Vim is often perceived as being difficult or having a high learning curve. However, with a minimal amount of knowledge and effort, Vim quickly becomes comfortable and is often described as being able to "speak" to the editor. 

Working comfortably and efficiently in Vim means learning a few basic concepts and commands. I'll attempt to cover some of the features I have found most useful to provide a solid foundation in Vim. There is a lot to learn and it depends on the individual, but it is often worth it to spend extra effort learning advanced concepts, installing plugins, and configuring the editor for convenience and speed. Some great resources include:
 - the built-in tutorial (vimtutor)
 - vimcasts.org, a variety of topics packaged into easily digestable videos
 - cheetsheets

#### Modal Editing

Vim uses the concept of "modes" to split up it functionality into logical groupings. 
There are several modes and the default mode at startup is Normal mode. This is the first stumbling block for most people. The natural inclination is to start typing and for text to appear on the screen. 

#### Speaking the Language

verb - modifier - object

#### Windows

#### Configuration and Personalization

#### Plugins
