Gotta get them green checkboxes, am I right?  
It is actually **not** the recommended practice to use multiple accounts to manage you personal and professional life on GitHub. 

Organizations
-------------
- use organizations
- publicizing organizations 

Setting Your Email Address
--------------------------
- setting your email address on a single repo
- adding an email address to your GitHub account

SSH and GPG Keys
-----------------
- managing ssh keys and gpg signatures

Notifications
-------------
- notifications

Leaving a Company
-----------------
- User Account
    - unverify your company email address (delete the email address) and then re-add it without verifying to keep associated commits linked 
    - make sure your primary is your personal email
    - make sure your primary email is verified 
    - if your github username has references to your old company/org you should change your github username as well 
- Leaving Orgs
  - transfer ownership if you're the sole owner
  - remove yourself
  - if you own the org and someone leaves you can also remove them manually 
- open an issue or pr to keep contributions in your contributions graph
