If you're not familiar with column select you're missing out on a ton of multi-line editing goodness. Just hold down the alt key while you're selecting items with your mouse and you'll see what I mean.<!--more-->

```
alt+left mouse
```

You can edit columns of information at once with out having to retype or paste in information over and over. Column select is a little difficult to explain so I created a quick screen capture to show off the awesomeness of this feature.

Again, all that going on here is a selection using the alt key plus the right mouse button. Then you just type away.
